Breadboard Utilities
====================
This is a collection of utilities in the form of PCBs mounted on a breadboard,
which distributes power to them. I've used them for testing and development
over the last few years.

These are being released with no warranty or support, and while they have been
useful to me, New Systems Instruments does not warrant their usefulness or
fitness for any particular purpose.

If you need help, please post in one of the usual public forums. I'm a helpful
kind of human, so I might respond in a forum, but I can't commit to giving any
support at all.

I am releasing my work according to the terms in LICENSE.txt. A few things in
here are the work of others, and AFAIK are freely distributable and compatible
with that license, but I do not consider this a relicensing or any alteration
significant enough to claim some part of copyright on those files.

Since the DIY community is often considerate of wishes beyond the legal
requirements, know that I'm happy for anyone who wishes to build these for
whatever purpose, alter them as long as it is clear that they are altered,
incorporate them into commercial products, make collective PCB runs with
other DIYers, etc. If you're selling them at scale for profit, contact me
first and maybe throw me a bone, but I'm sure we can work something out.

See the individual Read Me files for more details.

Breadboard Compatibility
------------------------
This works with common 0.1" pitch breadboards. Note that AFAIK there is no
fixed standard for breadboards, so there is no guarantee it will work with any
particular breadboard. The most common incompatibility I've seen is where the
rail pins are not aligned with the main pins of the breadboard.

The power is put on the rails as follows:

-12 GND ... GND +12

As I have not seen any standard breadboard which is labeled this way, it is
recommended that you write over the +/- symbols on your breadboard with a
permanent marker.
